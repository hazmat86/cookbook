After having satisfied the initial requirements for this project by using primarily HTML to design and style this webpage I am now adding features that will make the page much more visually satisfying for the end-user. The initial work that was done was to show my competancy with HTML to lay down a solid foundation that is ordered, syntactically correct, logical and possessing an intuitive design that is easily-navigable. Now I am going to use CSS coupled with HTML to provide a modern, sleek, and pleasing design. Just as the idea of the page in its prior form was to showcase my skills with HTML, keep in mind that this page's primary purpose is to show my competancy with CSS. As always, if anyone has any ideas, comments, questions, advice or just wants to chat please feel free to reach out to me!
