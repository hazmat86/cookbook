        <p class="mid">Welcome to my personal <em>Cooking-a-bok</em>! This cookbook is a small collection of Norse themed recipes that I have made and enjoy to this day. All of them use easy to find ingredients and have a small number of easy to follow steps. I hope you gain as much pleasure from these recipes as I have and that they inspire you on a journey down the winding road of ancient European cooking!</p>
