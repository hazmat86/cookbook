# cookbook
This simple project uses primarily HTML to create a website that acts as a simple recipe book as laid out in the first assignment within the Odin Project. I have used very little CSS in this as I have wanted to keep as close as possible to the assignment guidelines so that I can best showcase my ability to use HTML. Each of the pages contain a head that has metadata within it, as well as each page using semantic components to better organize the pages. While this page is simple I believe that it shows a webpage may be developed using the minimum amount of technology and still present an effective and visually clean appearance. If anyone has any ideas, suggestions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact me.
